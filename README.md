At this very time, the world is desperately struggling to overcome the immense damage done to the economy by this pandemic. As the lockdown is cautiously being lifted by many countries, their focus is to get on the same economic track as before. To do so, the industries are now re-opening with new safety measures in practice. After experiencing a cold market, the demand for raw materials is again on the rise and this has fueled the transport sector to maintain the balance between supply and demand. The import and export industries handle the international transportation of such materials. The lack of appreciation for such business fields in their contribution to the world economy inspired the authors of this report to explore this industry. Broadly based on real-life import and export industries, a hypothetical company was devised â€“ Corner-store Import and Export Ltd. Mock Sales data, along with Customer, Product and Region was generated which was then channeled into the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. The whole section of Sales of Company was studied and then visualized. The benefits from the same were reported.
